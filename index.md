Hi! I am Siddharth Chandak, a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I am advised by [Prof. Nick Bambos](https://profiles.stanford.edu/nicholas-bambos). In addition, I am fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Vivek S. Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/vivek-shripad-borkar/) from IIT Bombay and [Prof. Ilai Bistritz](https://sites.google.com/view/ilaibistritz/) from Tel Aviv University. Prior to this, I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay (India) in 2021, winning the President of India Gold Medal. 

I am currently working on multi-agent systems, with a focus on distributed learning of optimal equilibria for unknown systems and controlling multi-agent systems with bandit feedback. In addition, I am studying various two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms and their applications in optimization, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent learning. This is a sub-theme of my research on stochastic approximation and its applications in reinforcement learning. Broadly, I am interested in probability, optimization and learning theory.

I am also interested in teaching and related activities. In Spring 2024 and Spring 2025, I served as the head TA for [ENGR 76](https://web.stanford.edu/class/engr76/) (Information Science and Engineering), a course taken by over 300 students each year. The course introduces undergraduate students at Stanford to the fundamentals behind modern information and communication systems. In addition, I have served as TA for courses such as Linear Dynamical Systems (EE 263), Game Theory (MS&E 232) and Information Networks & Services (MS&E 130) at Stanford and as undergraduate TA for multiple Math and Physics courses at IIT Bombay.
