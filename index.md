Hi! I am Siddharth Chandak, a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I am advised by [Prof. Nick Bambos](https://profiles.stanford.edu/nicholas-bambos). In addition, I am fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Vivek S. Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/vivek-shripad-borkar/) from IIT Bombay and [Prof. Ilai Bistritz](https://sites.google.com/view/ilaibistritz/) from Tel Aviv University. Prior to this, I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay (India) in 2021, winning the President of India Gold Medal. 

#### Research Interests  
**Multi-Agent Learning and Control:** My research focuses on multi-agent systems and games, with an emphasis on developing algorithms for distributed learning of equilibria for unknown systems. I also study problems in game control, where the aim is to steer players toward equilibria that satisfy both the local and global objectives.  

**Stochastic Approximation:** I am interested in developing new frameworks for  stochastic approximation schemes which enable the design and analysis of algorithms in optimization and reinforcement learning. In addition, I work on obtaining tighter finite-time guarantees for reinforcement learning algorithms.  

#### Teaching  
I am also interested in teaching and mentorship. In Winter 2026, I will serve as the instructor for the course [ENGR 76](https://web.stanford.edu/class/engr76/) (Information Science and Engineering). The course introduces undergraduate students at Stanford to the fundamentals behind modern information and communication systems. I previously served as the head TA for ENGR 76 in Spring 2024 and 2025, supporting a class of about 300 students each year. In addition, I have been a TA for courses such as Linear Dynamical Systems (EE 263), Game Theory (MS&E 232) and Information Networks & Services (MS&E 130) at Stanford, and as undergraduate TA for multiple Math and Physics courses at IIT Bombay.
