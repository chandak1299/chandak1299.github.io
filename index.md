Hi! I am Siddharth Chandak, a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I am advised by [Prof. Nick Bambos](https://profiles.stanford.edu/nicholas-bambos) and am also working with [Prof. Vivek S. Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/borkar) from IIT Bombay. My research interests are multi-agent systems and theoretical reinforcement learning. Before this I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay (India) in 2021.
