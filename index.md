Hi! I am Siddharth Chandak, a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I am advised by [Prof. Nick Bambos](https://profiles.stanford.edu/nicholas-bambos). In addition, I am fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Vivek S. Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/vivek-shripad-borkar/) from IIT Bombay and [Prof. Ilai Bistritz](https://sites.google.com/view/ilaibistritz/) from Tel Aviv University. Prior to this, I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay (India) in 2021, winning the President of India Gold Medal. 

I am currently working on multi-agent systems, with a focus on distributed learning of optimal equilibria for unknown systems and controlling multi-agent systems with bandit feedback. Another field I am currently interested in is stochastic approximation and its applications in theoretical reinforcement learning. Broadly, I am interested in probability, optimization and learning theory.
